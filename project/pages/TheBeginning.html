<h1>How I Became Obsessed with Soccer</h1>

<p>
    It was just an average Saturday in 2010 but little did I know this day would start the beginning of a special journey. 
    That day was the first day that I would ever play soccer. 
    When I stepped on that field I had no clue what was going on but all I knew was that it was fun. 
    After playing for 3 years the only goal I had scored was on my own net but that didn't deter me from the sport.
    Eventually I couldn't go an entire week without playing soccer in my backyard with my dad. 
    When I was younger I was playing many different sports but I really started to focus on soccer starting in middle school.
    This allowed me to improve at a much faster rate than before making me even more obsessed.
    However, the event that made me really fall for the sport was when I starting watching soccer on TV and seeing what was really possible at the highest level.
