<h1>How Watching Soccer Helped Me Improve on the Field</h1>

</div>

    <p id = "p1">
    The first game I ever watched was actually by accident. It was the 2014 World Cup final and I turned it on about 60 minutes on because there was nothing else to do. 
    Little did I know what decision would impact my life forever as from that point on I haven't stopped watching soccer. 
    I was a casual watcher until 2017 which was when I felt like I finally had seen enough to pick a team. 
    The team I chose was Manchester city because Kevin De Bruyne was and still is my favorite player off all time. 
    Watching him play actually made me better at the sport also because I could see the game from a Birds Eye view allowing me to learn from a third person perspective. 
    This past December when Messi finally lifted the FIFA World Cup it felt like a full circle moment for me since the first match i ever watched was him losing the world cup final. 
    Seeing the greatest player of all time finally solify himself as a god above all others was really special not to mention that world cup finally was arguably the greatest game of all time.
    Throughout the years of watching constant soccer I have completely transformed my on field performances and continue to do so.
    Now that I have in depth knowledge of the sport watching it has become even better because I can look into the plays that are happening and inform other people in my family that don't know much about it.
