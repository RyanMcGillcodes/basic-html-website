<h1>Fun Facts</h1>

</div>

<p>
    My career has so far last 13 years and is going strong. 
    I had too many injuries in high school to get recruited for college but I am an officially a part of 2 intramural teams and also unofficially part of 2 more. 
    Soccer is a time to forget all school work and just have fun with people you enjoy being around. 
    Especially in high school with those big games under the lights and all the fans cheering it gave you a real purpose to be on that field.
