<h1>Playing Soccer</h1>

</div>

<p>
My career so far has lasted 13 years and is going strong. 
The first time I fully focused on soccer and began to actually improve was in middle school.
It was also helpful in middle school because the coaches went from parents to actual coaches who had knowledge of the sport.
Throughout these years in middle school I was constantly working on my craft and trying new things to try and give me a slight edge.
Once I got to high school though it was very different because most other kids on the team had already hit puberty which made it very difficult to get playing time freshman year.
Going into sophomore year I was ready to play and the coaches could also see that. 
This year would turn out to be the best year of my career where I played every game for JV and we just missed out on the playoffs.
Junior year I wouldn't get so lucky; I broke my left ankle over the summer and it wouldn't be ready in time for the season.
For this reason I switched to my other sport, golf, and won a state championship while the soccer team didn't make the playoffs so I guess everything happens for a reason.
Senior season I weighed my options but I felt like I belonged more on the golf course and my team depended on me as I had been named a captain.
Once again we won the state championship and soccer didn't even make the playoffs.
Even though I didn't play soccer in the fall I kept playing in the spring where my team went undefeated for 2 seasons up until the very last game.
Also even though I wasn't on the soccer team anymore a lot of my friends were so I would go to every game home or away and watch them play.
Soccer is a time to forget all school work and just have fun with people you enjoy being around. 
Especially in high school with those big games under the lights and all the fans cheering it gave you a real purpose to be on that field.
Athletes live for the little moments and although we never won trophies in high school I still loved being a part of the process. 
Losing in soccer and knowing we had to improve actually felt better than winning the state championship in golf and knowing nobody was better than us.
