My Journey Through Soccer 
</h1>
</div>
<p>
    Soccer to many is just a sport but to me it has become a staple in my daily life. 
    Anytime I get the chance I am either watching or playing soccer with friends. 
    I cannot imagine a life in which soccer is not an almost daily occurrence. 
    On this site you can find information from my favorite teams, to some interesting facts about the history of the sport, to the best players in the world.
